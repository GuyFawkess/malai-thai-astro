  - Neck & Shoulder Massage is a targeted therapy designed to release built-up tension in the upper body, especially in areas commonly affected by stress, posture, and daily strain.
  - This treatment focuses on the neck, shoulders, and upper backâ€”regions that often carry the weight of long working hours, desk jobs, or emotional stress. Through a combination of kneading, pressure point work, and gentle stretching, the massage helps loosen tight muscles and improve blood flow.
  - It's performed either seated or lying down, with or without oils, depending on your comfort. The technique is both effective and time-efficient, making it a great option for those looking for quick but impactful relief.
  - Whether you suffer from stiffness, headaches, or just need to unwind after a long day, a Neck & Shoulder Massage provides focused care that restores ease and mobility in your upper body.
